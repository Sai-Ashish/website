I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at UCSD working with Professor Pengtao Xie. I am currently working on formulating multi-level optimization frameworks for problems in Deep-learning. The multi-level optimization in Deep-learning can be viewed as a solution to Auto-AI, where the unknown parameters are optimized subject to some constraints. Neural Architecture Search comes under this framework. I am currently working on formulating a framework for automated data augmentation in NLP, such as text classification, summarization, etc. I am working on learning more and gaining expertise in the NLP field. I am also working on stable learning algorithms to finetune LLMs on low-resource datasets. 

Apart from my academic interests, I love watching movies. My favorite genre is thriller movies. I love debating, especially on topics such as politics. I like traveling and getting to know new people and cultures. I have traveled to over nine countries by now. I want to visit all the countries in the world by the time I am old.
